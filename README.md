# Analysis-of-Apple-Stock-Volatility-Modeling-and-Option-Pricing

##Objective: 
Analyzed Apple stock data to model volatility and price derivative securities using advanced quantitative techniques.

##Scope of Work:
Collected and processed 3+ years of daily stock price data.
Modeled stock price behavior using Geometric Brownian Motion and non-constant volatility models.
Visualized the volatility smile, term structure, and volatility surface.
Priced European call options using Monte Carlo simulation, numerical PDE methods, binomial models, and the Black-Scholes formula.
Performed variance reduction techniques in Monte Carlo simulations to improve efficiency for path-dependent options.

##Outcome: 
Delivered a comparative analysis of option pricing methodologies, highlighting their accuracy, computational efficiency, and sources of error, with actionable suggestions to mitigate inaccuracies.
Skills Applied: Data processing and analysis, volatility modeling, option pricing, Monte Carlo simulations, numerical methods, financial engineering tools, and teamwork.
